We will be exploring Airbnb listings from the USA; the main goal of this Kernel will be exploring the data and predicting the price of a listing given a new sample. 
Our methodology in this Kernel will follow a standard analysis and prediction methodology, 
where we will first assess the data for any missing values followed by outlier imputation. The next stage will be the EDA.
